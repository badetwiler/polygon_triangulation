Purpose:

This project demonstrates triangulation of polygons (without holes) using 
monotone polygon decomposition.


Directions:

An initial polygon is drawn on the page when loaded.  Either click 'Triangulate' or 
"Clear Screen".  Once the screen is cleared, the user may click on the screen to 
draw a new polygon to triangulate.  Use the slider bar on the left to configure
the max triangle size.  When slid all the way to the right, the monotone polygons
are displayed that the algorithm initiallize decomposes the polygon into. Mouse scroll
zooms in and out.
